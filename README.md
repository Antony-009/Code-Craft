# 🚀 CodeCraft

**CodeCraft** is an interactive web platform that provides **visualizations** for  
🧠 **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms**, and 🌐 **Networking Protocols** — built using **Next.js**, **JavaScript**, and modern web technologies.  

It helps learners and developers **understand complex concepts visually** and **experiment interactively**.

## 🌟 Features

### 🧩 DSA Visualization
- Interactive visual demonstrations for:
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.
- Step-by-step algorithm animations:
  - Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)
  - Searching (Binary, Linear)
  - Pathfinding (Dijkstra, BFS, DFS)

### 🤖 AI Algorithm Visualization
- Learn AI logic through real-time animations.
- Algorithms include:
  - A*, Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Genetic Algorithm, etc.
- Adjustable parameters (speed, heuristics, iterations)

### 🌐 Networking Protocol Simulation
- Visualize how data moves across networks.
- Includes:
  - TCP/IP, ARP, HTTP, DNS, DHCP protocols
- Simulated packet flow and request/response cycles.
